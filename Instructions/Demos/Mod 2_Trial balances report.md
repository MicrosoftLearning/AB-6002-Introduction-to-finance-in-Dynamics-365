## Module 2: Describe reporting and integration capabilities 

## Demo: Run Trial balances report

In this demo, you will show the process of running the Trial balance report as a grid and then exporting it from Dynamics 365 Finance.

1.  Go to **General ledger \> Inquiries and reports \> Trial balance**.
2.  Explain the trial balance report.
    -   The **Trial balance as grid** report provides a quick, interactive way to review account balances directly. Unlike the other trial balance reports available (**Trial balance with transactional detail**), which are formatted for printing or financial statement review, the grid view lets you filter, sort, and export live data to Excel for analysis.
3.  In the **Parameters** section, select the **Date interval**. This sets the **From date** and **To date** automatically based on the interval. Explain that you can choose a specific **From date** and **To date** if a **Date interval** does not meet the requirements to run the report.
    -   Use 2018 data (1/1/2018 – 12/31/2028) for the demo to show full data sets in the report.
4.  Choose the **Financial dimension set** (for example, Main) and set the **Posting layer** (for example, Current).
5.  Select **Calculate balances**. The report will run and be displayed based on the selected parameters you just set.
6.  Briefly show the displayed report balances and accounts. This report displays the information in a grid on the screen.
    -   The report provides balance information for all accounts. It also includes debit and credit balances, and the net of these, together with the transaction date, voucher, and journal description.
7.  Show that you can select the blue hyperlinks to view the transactions for the accounts.
    -   Select a balance hyperlink to view the transactions and return to the main trial balance. Demonstrate that you can easily explore the report and transactions on the screen.
8.  Point out the **Totals** section at the bottom of the screen.
9.  After the results display and you have reviewed the main report components, show the report **Export to Excel** functionality.
10. Select the **Open in Microsoft Office** button in the Action pane, and then select **Export to Excel \> Trial balance**. Select **Download**. The file is generated and downloaded.
11. Open the downloaded Excel file to view the trial balance data. Explain that this functionality opens the data that was previously filtered in the grid.
