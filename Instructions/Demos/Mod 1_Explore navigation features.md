Module 1: Describe the finance and operations apps demo

In this demo, you will explore navigation features in Dynamics 365 Finance.

1.  Open Dynamics 365 Finance. Change the company to **USMF** if you’re not already in this legal entity.
2.  Select the hamburger menu to show the navigation bar words, and then pin it. Select the hamburger menu again to remove the words and have just the icons.
3.  Use the search bar to search for **Customers**. Show the results and how they indicate the path to get to a particular form.
4.  Discuss the value of workspaces customized to a role to help a person kick off their day. Explain the basic layout of a workspace. Use the **Customer credit and collections** workspace as an example.
-   Tiles with counts at top
-   Lists in center
-   Links
    -   Possible analytics page (show analytics for this workspace)
1.  **If you have Copilot available**, select it and prompt it with, “Provide a summary of our aged customer balances.” Notice that the response is generic. Change the response to be more specific: “Can you tell me which customer owes us the most amount of money?” You are told which reports you can review. Without an agent that specifically understands this question, you will not get a result but will be told how to get a result.
2.  Right-click the customer list page grid and insert a column. Select the **Terms of payment** field. Move it to the left of **Customer** group. Save the view as **Payment terms**. Pin the view as your default.
3.  Open the **Aged balances** form from **Credit and collections**.
4.  Open **Customers** and show that the pinned view is your default view and is opened.
5.  Enter an **N** in the quick filter and show that you get a list of fields. Select **Terms of payment**. Finish entering **Net30** and press Enter. Explain that the grid filtered for you.
6.  Clear the quick filter.
7.  Select the column header for **Terms of Payment** and filter on **contains** **30**. Discuss the options that were available in addition to **Contains**. Show that almost the same results are displayed.
8.  In preparation for the lab, display the **Customer credit and collections** page and explain the layout so learners understand the concepts of tiles and lists in a workspace.
